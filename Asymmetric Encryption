Private key: L2Kdim2t5KevDVdtn6MKWWsNwgxW21GXdtZsejzd9iHMEoVhoeC8 
Public key: 1CxotsS1ud2edMfqXdWnocVDdk65dntFYj 
Transaction hash: adc2d89ef5d2c50088927fa6ca3ba3d18d0624b6171d5ef3862d12e16f66e78d

True or False: In asymmetric cryptography, the private key "L2Kdim2t5KevDVdtn6MKWWsNwgxW21GXdtZsejzd9iHMEoVhoeC8" corresponds to a specific public key.

Answer: True. In asymmetric cryptography, a specific private key corresponds to a unique public key. The public key is derived from the private key using a one-way cryptographic algorithm.

True or False: The transaction hash "adc2d89ef5d2c50088927fa6ca3ba3d18d0624b6171d5ef3862d12e16f66e78d" is the result of hashing the transaction data using a cryptographic hash function.

Answer: True. Transaction hashes are typically generated by applying a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256) to the transaction data, resulting in a fixed-length string that uniquely represents the transaction.

True or False: Given a valid transaction and its transaction hash "adc2d89ef5d2c50088927fa6ca3ba3d18d0624b6171d5ef3862d12e16f66e78d," it is computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the private key "L2Kdim2t5KevDVdtn6MKWWsNwgxW21GXdtZsejzd9iHMEoVhoeC8."

Answer: True. A secure cryptographic hash function should make it computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the original input (in this case, the private key) from its hash value. This property is known as pre-image resistance.

True or False: The public key "1CxotsS1ud2edMfqXdWnocVDdk65dntFYj" is the result of applying a specific cryptographic algorithm to the private key "L2Kdim2t5KevDVdtn6MKWWsNwgxW21GXdtZsejzd9iHMEoVhoeC8."

Answer: True. The public key is generated from the private key using a specific algorithm, often based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) or RSA. The details of the algorithm may vary depending on the cryptographic system used.

True or False: Given a transaction hash "adc2d89ef5d2c50088927fa6ca3ba3d18d0624b6171d5ef3862d12e16f66e78d" and its corresponding transaction data, it is possible to verify the integrity of the transaction by recomputing the hash and comparing it to the provided hash.

Answer: True. To verify the integrity of a transaction, one can recompute the hash of the transaction data and compare it to the provided transaction hash. If the two hashes match, it indicates that the transaction data has not been altered, and the transaction is valid and authentic.
