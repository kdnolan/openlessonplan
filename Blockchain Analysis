## Multiple Choice Questions

**Question 1:** What does a Bitcoin Transaction ID (TXID) typically look like?

a) A random alphanumeric string, composed of letters and numbers.
b) A unique 64-character hexadecimal code, starting with "0x".
c) A 256-bit binary number, represented as a sequence of 0s and 1s.
d) A public key associated with the sender's Bitcoin wallet.

**Correct answer:** b) A unique 64-character hexadecimal code, starting with "0x".

Explanation: A Bitcoin Transaction ID (TXID) is a unique identifier for a specific transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. It is represented as a 64-character hexadecimal code, which means it contains characters from the set of 0-9 and A-F (e.g., 0x2a7c87453f1d97a3e1bcba9c3e57c75dc980f26257e773da5303543db34f0e8d). This TXID helps users and explorers to locate and verify transactions on the blockchain.

B) Messages are delivered on a best effort basis
C) Messages are encrypted and sent through a central server
D) Messages are broadcast to all nodes simultaneously

**Answer:** B) Messages are delivered on a best effort basis

**Question 6:** What is the relationship between the probability of a successful attack on the Bitcoin network and the number of honest nodes controlling CPU power?

A) The probability increases linearly with the number of honest nodes
B) The probability decreases linearly with the number of honest nodes
C) The probability drops off exponentially with the number of honest nodes
D) The probability is not affected by the number of honest nodes

**Answer:** C) The probability drops off exponentially with the number of honest nodes
